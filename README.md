# SOAR A4 Methodology
**Ryan McAlister**

The A4 method (Apps, Assets, Actions, and Artifacts) provides a structured framework for developing automated response capabilities within SOAR, helping you build effective, scalable, and efficient incident response workflows.

## 1. Apps
**Purpose:** Apps enable connectivity to external systems, defining the logic for executing actions within those systems.

**Usage:**
- Identify which tools and platforms need to be integrated (e.g., firewalls, endpoint protection, SIEM).
- Install or develop SOAR apps that correspond to these systems.
- Ensure the apps contain the necessary actions for your response workflows.

## 2. Assets
**Purpose:** Assets are configured instances of apps with specific connection details, enabling them to securely connect to systems.

**Usage:**
- For each app, set up assets by providing the required connection details, such as API keys, IP addresses, or URLs.
- Test the asset connections to confirm they’re able to perform actions as intended.
- Label and document each asset with a clear name and purpose, such as “Palo Alto Firewall - Production” or “CrowdStrike EDR - Incident Response.”

## 3. Actions
**Purpose:** Actions are the tasks SOAR can execute on assets, which are defined within the apps.

**Usage:**
- Review the list of available actions for each asset to understand what tasks can be automated.
- Choose actions that align with your incident response use cases, such as blocking IPs or retrieving event logs.
- Map actions to incident response playbooks based on the needs of specific workflows.

## 4. Artifacts
**Purpose:** Artifacts are data objects related to security incidents, providing context and enabling data enrichment in response workflows.

**Usage:**
- Use artifacts to pass data between actions within a playbook, such as passing an IP address for enrichment.
- Ensure common artifact types (e.g., IP, URL, email address) are consistently formatted to streamline automation.
- Collect artifacts from various sources within the SOAR platform to build a full picture.

## A4 Methodology Example

| Category  | Example              | Description                                                                                     | Additional Details                                                  |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Apps**  | Proofpoint TAP       | An email security integration app that allows interaction with Proofpoint’s Threat Protection API for detecting and responding to phishing attacks. | Available actions: Fetch Threat Logs, Block Sender, Isolate User.   |
| **Apps**  | SentinelOne          | An endpoint protection and response app that allows managing SentinelOne’s threat intelligence and response capabilities. | Available actions: Quarantine Device, Retrieve Threat Details, Terminate Process. |
| **Apps**  | VirusTotal           | Threat intelligence platform integration for performing file and URL reputation checks.          | Available actions: Enrich File Hash, Enrich URL, Scan File.         |
| **Assets**| Proofpoint TAP - Production | A configured instance of the Proofpoint TAP app with production environment API credentials.    | Base URL: https://api.proofpoint.com                                |
| **Assets**| SentinelOne - Dev    | A development instance of the SentinelOne app for testing workflows securely.                    | Details stored securely; no sensitive information in table.         |
| **Assets**| VirusTotal Public    | A public asset for VirusTotal with limited API access for URL and file scanning.                 | API Key stored securely within asset configuration.                 |
| **Actions** | Block Sender       | Blocks the specified sender in Proofpoint TAP, preventing further emails from the sender.        | Required parameters: Sender Email Address                           |
| **Actions** | Quarantine Device  | Isolates an endpoint from the network via SentinelOne, allowing further investigation.           | Required parameters: Device ID                                      |
| **Actions** | Enrich File Hash   | Checks a file hash against VirusTotal’s database to retrieve reputation and threat intelligence. | Required parameters: File Hash                                      |
| **Artifacts** | IP Address       | An IP address associated with a suspicious event or incident.                                   | Common Sources: Firewall Logs, Threat Intelligence Feeds            |
| **Artifacts** | File Hash        | A hash representing a potentially malicious file that needs analysis.                           | Common Sources: EDR Logs, Sandbox Analysis                          |
| **Artifacts** | URL              | A URL flagged as suspicious that requires threat intelligence enrichment.                       | Common Sources: Web Proxy Logs, Email Gateways                      |
